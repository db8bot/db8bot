It is this fact of being constantly seen, of being able always to be seen, that maintains the disciplined individual in his subjection. And the examination is the technique by which power, instead of emitting the signs of its potency, instead of imposing its mark on its subjects, holds them in a mechanism of objectification.

It does not keep itself out of sight of witnesses, or of its partner. True love is love without disguise. Second, true love is an unalloyed love, that is to say, without mixture of pleasure and displeasure. It is also a love in which sensual pleasure and the friendship of souls do not intermingle. To that extend it is therefore a pure love because unalloyed. Third, true love (alethes eros) is love which is in line with what is right, what is correct. It is a direct (euthus) love.

Instead, at all times when socialism was forced to insist on the problem of struggle, the fight against the enemy, the elimination of the adversary within the capitalist society; When it comes, to think about the physical confrontation with the class adversary in the capitalist society, the racism resurfaced, because it was the only way I had a socialist thought, which in any case was very linked to the subject of biopoder, to think The reason for killing the adversary.

Cuando se trata simplemente de eliminarlo económicamente, de hacerle perder sus privilegios , el racismo no hace falta .

In our culture (and doubtless in many others), discourse was not originally a product, a thing, a kind of goods; it was essentially an act _ an act placed in the bipolar field of the sacred and the profane, the licit and the illicit, the religious and the blasphemous. Historically, it was a gesture fraught with risks before becoming goods caught up in a circuit of ownership.",

The author’s name manifests the appearance of a certain discursive set and indicates the status of this discourse within a society and a culture. It has no legal status, nor is it located in the fiction of the work; rather, it is located in the break that founds a certain discursive construct and its very particular mode of being. As a result, we could say that in a civilization like our own there are a certain number of discourses that are endowed with the “author-function”, while others are deprived of it. A private letter may well have a signer_ it does not have an author; a contract may well have a guarantor_ it does not have an author. An anonymous text posted on a wall probably has a writer_ but not an author. The author-function is therefore characteristic of the mode of existence, circulation, and functioning of certain discourses within a society.",

When he is told: “You are only your labor-power and I have paid the market price for it,”‡ and when so much wealth is put in his hands, it is necessary to inject into the relationship between the worker and what he is working on a whole series of obligations and constraints that overlay the law of wages, which is apparently the simple law of the market.§ The wage contract must be accompanied by a coercion that is like its validity clause: the working class must be “regenerated,” “moralized.” Thus the transfer of the penitentiary takes place with one social class applying it to another: it is in this class relationship between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat that the condensed and remodeled penitentiary system begins to function; it will be a political instrument of the control and maintenance of relations of production. Fourth, something more is needed for this supplementary code to function effectively and for the delinquent actually to appear as a social enemy: the actual separation of delinquents from non-delinquents within those lower strata practicing illegalism. The great continuous mass of economico-political illegalism, going from common law crime to political revolt, must be broken up and the purely delinquent must be placed on one side, and those free of delinquency, who may be called non-delinquent, on the other. Thus, the bourgeoisie has no great wish to suppress delinquency.18 The main objective of the penal system is breaking this continuum of lower-class illegalism and the organization of a world of delinquency. There are two instruments for this. On the one hand, an ideological instrument: the theory of the delinquent as social enemy. This is no longer someone who struggles against the law, who wishes to evade power, but someone who is at war with every member of society. And the suddenly monstrous face the criminal assumes at the end of the eighteenth century, in literature and in penal theorists, corresponds to this need to break lower-class illegalism",

    "original": "Foucault —siempre hablando de aquellos tres «fundadores de discurso»— dice que Marx no se limita a interpretar a la sociedad burguesa, sino a la interpretación burguesa de la sociedad (por eso El capital no es una economía política, sino una crítica de la economía política); que Freud no interpreta el sueño del paciente, sino el relato que el paciente hace de su sueño (y que ya constituye, desde luego, una «interpretación», en el sentido vulgar o «silvestre»); que Nietzsche no interpreta a la moral de Occidente, sino al discurso que Occidente ha construido sobre la moral (por eso hace una genealogía de la moral). Se trata, siempre, de una interpretación que hace ver que esos discursos que examina son, justamente, interpretaciones —«producciones» de sentido— y no meros objetos complicados a descifrar, con un sentido dado desde siempre que sólo se trata de re-descubrir. Lo que hacen los tres, nuevamente es intervenir sobre una construcción simbólica no para mostrar su transparencia originaria, sino al revés, para producirla como opacidad; no para descifrarla, sino al revés, para otorgarle su carácter de cifra, su «artificialidad», es decir, para desnaturalizarla en su función de «sentido común», y para desnaturalizar, también, la relación de ese discurso con los sujetos que ha producido como soportes de su propia reproducción. Se trata, en fin, de quebrar esa armonía y ese bienestar, de transformar al sujeto, mediante la interpretación, en insoportable para su propio discurso y quizá dejarlo, momentáneamente, sin palabras.",

Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint. And it induces regular effects of power. Each society has its regime of truth, its “general politics” of truth—that is, the types of discourse it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances that enable one to distinguish true and false statements; the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true.",
